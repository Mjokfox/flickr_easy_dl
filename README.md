# flickr_easy_dl
Download images in highest quality with just a single click, from anywhere on flickr!

## Installation

1. Install a [Userscript Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager) of your choice. I recommend [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).
    > - [violentmonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)<br>
    > - [violentmonkey for Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)<br>
    > - [violentmonkey for Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/violentmonkey/eeagobfjdenkkddmbclomhiblgggliao)<br>
    or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), which is not open source..
    > - [tampermonkey for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)<br>
    > - [tampermonkey for Safari (MacOS/iOS/iPadOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887)<br>

2. Install **flickr easy dl** by clicking **[this link](https://github.com/Mjokfox/flickr_easy_dl/raw/refs/heads/main/flickrezdl.user.js)**.

## Usage
After installation you can now find download icons inside the images within a photostream, and a floating button int the bottom right when viewing a single image (i am open to suggestions on placement). Simply click on the download button, and after a couple seconds (it does take a bit most of the time) you will have the highest quality version of that image in your downloads folder!
